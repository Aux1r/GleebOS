GleebOS is an Operating System intended to run on computers in the Minecraft mod 'OpenComputers'. It is currently in development
and is intended to be a GUI-based 'base control' system with tools for mods like ICBM-Classic, Mekanism, AE2, etc.
The current code is mainly derived from Gisp-OS and MineOS as well as the API documentation available on the Lua and OpenComputers Wiki.
